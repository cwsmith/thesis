A review of (hyper)graph, recursive sectioning geometric, and diffusive
partitioning methods is located in Section~\ref{sec:partitioning}.
Section~\ref{sec:requirements} introduces the dynamic partitioning problem and
how our approach meets the requirements to solve it effectively.
Section~\ref{sec:pumi} reviews the partitioned mesh representation in the Parallel
Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure (PUMI)~\cite{ibanez2016pumi,WOLFHPC}.
Sections~\ref{sec:parma} through~\ref{sec:entSelection} detail partition improvement
procedures to support application specific partition requirements.
Section~\ref{sec:results} begins with a comparison of ParMA and its predecessor,
\mbox{LIIPBMod}.
Next, we present a ParMA feature comparison test and multi-criteria partitioning
results on meshes with over 12 billion elements running on over one million cores.
Section~\ref{sec:results} closes with a discussion of scaling improvement
in a CFD analysis running on over a half-million cores.
