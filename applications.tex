\section{Summary}
In-memory and semi-automated workflows for three industrial applications were
demonstrated.
For the in-memory PHASTA application the challenge was to work with the
limitations of the industrial partners structural mechanics code while providing
a workflow that efficiently simulated the complex multi-phase flow.
The second and third applications emphasized the definition of workflow
automation to limit the time the analyst or engineer spends setting up problems or
running simulations.
